# TMNT retail sales dashboard from Jan-May 2020

## Introduction
This project is to display my data cleaning, transformation, modeling, and visualization skill using Excel. This is an Excel project on sales analysis of an imaginary store called TMNT Stores.

_Disclaimer: All datasets and reports do not represent any company, institution, or country, but are just dummy datasets to demonstrate my capabilities in Excel_.

## Problem statement

What is the total revenue?

What is the total profit made?

Make a report for;

i)	Revenue trend?

ii)	Products by revenue?

iii)	Revenue contribution (%) of the product categories?

iv)	Sales by revenue also show their population and the median income?

Create a dashboard with the reports and make it sliceable by:

i.	Product category

Include a textbox to highlight the following insights:

i.	Which are the 2 top revenue products in Jan?

ii.	Which sales team made the most revenue from decoratives in March?

iii.	What is the relationship between revenue, population, and the median income of states?

## Skills/ concepts demonstrated:

The following Excel features were incorporated:

Pivot tables

New measures 

PowerPivot

Modelling 

## Data Source

 Revenue where highest in January and may and lowest in Febuary and April.

Visual  5

![](https://github.com/bellaTHEanalyst/TMNT-sales-analysis.EXCEL-project/blob/main/analysation/relationship%20trend.jpg)

  An increase in population leads to an increase in median income, which in turn leads to an increase in revenue, following the   observed trend .
  

Analysis 6 (answer for the questions to be in the textbox)

1 Wreaths and wine where the top two revenue products in January.

2 Donald Raynold's team made most from decoratives in March 

3  The higher the population the higher the revenue and the lower the population the lower the revenue and median income 


## Visualization 

Pivot charts

A dashboard was created for visualizations according to pivot tables.

##  Recommendation/conclusion.

I recommend that:

Top5 teams that contributes highest to revenue should be rewarded to encourage them and boost future sales.

more stores can be opened in  Califonia, Texas and Illinois as the population in those states are high and so far they contribute most to revenue.

states where sales are poor should be looked into.
