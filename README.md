This project is for skills practice

## Introduction
This project is to display my data cleaning, transformation, modeling, and visualization skill using Excel. This is an Excel project on sales analysis of an imaginary store called TMNT Stores.

## Problem statement

What is the total revenue?

What is the total profit made?

Make a report for;

i)	Revenue trend?

ii)	Products by revenue?

iii)	Revenue contribution (%) of the product categories?

iv)	Sales by revenue also show their population and the median income?

Create a dashboard with the reports and make it sliceable by:

i.	Product category

Include a textbox to highlight the following insights:

i.	Which are the 2 top revenue products in Jan?

ii.	Which sales team made the most revenue from decoratives in March?

iii.	What is the relationship between revenue, population, and the median income of states?

## Skills/ concepts demonstrated:

The following Excel features were incorporated:

Pivot tables

New measures
